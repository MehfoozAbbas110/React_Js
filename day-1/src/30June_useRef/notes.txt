useRef Hook-

It lets us to reference a value which is not needed for rendering(page reload by useState, useEffect).
 
It returns a object which has only one key i.e. 'current', so if we initialize a useRef as const count=useRef(0) then it looks like below:-
      'count= {current: 0}' where current is a key and 0 is value and to access the value we write 'count.current'

It is also to be use to store the previous state value by using , useState, useEffect and obiously useRef

Updating the Reference does not trigger the re-rendering while updating the state the component re-renders. so it means if we update useRef its value is available then only while updating the useState it renders the page then update the value
